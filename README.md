## Description

This repository contains two main scripts `prepack.ts` and `index.ts`

### The `prepack.ts` script

This script is a prepack step that:
- Downloads the specified version of the ENT Stack repository.
- Removes unnecessary files (like the .git folder and LICENSE).
- Adds .env files with default values for backend and frontend applications.
- Packages the prepared repository into a .tar.gz archive for distribution.

### The `index.ts` script

This script is a CLI tool for scaffolding a new ENT Stack project. It:
- Prompts the user for a project name and validates it.
- Extracts the source files from a prepackaged tarball.
- Creates a new project directory and copies scaffolded files into it.
- Customizes project files like package.json, .env, manifest.ts, and layout.tsx with project-specific values.
- Generates a basic README.md.
- Outputs the project path and setup instructions for the user.
